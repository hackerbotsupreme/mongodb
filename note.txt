the firsst thing we will do is to create a root folder for our project  
and 

then the first thing we need is package.json ,so we will run  npm init -y 
here -y means yes flag which tells to accept the default setup The "-y" flag in "npm init -y" is needed to skip the interactive setup process and automatically accept default configurations.

then we need express , node , mongodb
for express -> npm i  express -> this will download express for the project and also
add expresss as dependency under the dependencies in the package.json file .
for mongoose -> npm i  mongoose -> it will help connect node with mongodb 

and now we will need a template engine for our project which is handlebars 
for hba -> npm i hbs 

so now we got all the packages 
go check 
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "hbs": "^4.2.0",
    "mongoose": "^8.0.0"
  }
inside the package.json
