now  what mongodb does is it starts mongodb server . 
remeber you cant connect to the database untill you sstart the server . 
no server , no database , simple .
in the previous servers we needed to start and run the server all the time in a different shell ,
but in the latest version that server runs auomatically in the background you can open task manager(ctrl + shift+esc) and  verify it . 

so we dont have to start the server by ourselves , we need to make sure the mongoosh shell is installed so that we can 
connect to  the database , perform queries ,documents..etc. 
type mongosh in terminal -> 

            PS C:\Users\rekha> mongosh
            Current Mongosh Log ID: 654308c5e2913325ed2e7493

            To help improve our products, anonymous usage data is collected and sent to MongoDB periodically (https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy).
            You can opt-out by running the disableTelemetry() command.

            ------
            The server generated these startup warnings when booting
            2023-11-01T22:07:13.243+05:30: Access control is not enabled for the database. Read and write access to data and configuration is unrestricted
            ------

then  type  -> 
show dbs 
its saying show databases 
it will show 
        admin   40.00 KiB
        config  12.00 KiB
        local   40.00 KiB

Managing databasess  in mongodb 

ok first how the flow goes is database have collections and collections have documents

so there are two main   things ,
creating / deleting Databases 
creating / deleting collections 


Managing databases and collections 
command -> 
show dbs 
use <database-name> -> command to create database 
db.dropDatabase(); -> command to delete database 

for collections, command ->
show collections ;
db.createCollection('<collection-name>');-> command to create collections
db.<collection-name>.drop(); -> command to delete collections

open powershell ,
tostart working in mongodb , type mongosh
        PS C:\Users\rekha> mongosh
        Current Mongosh Log ID: 65436acc8d98d1e78d35c046

        Using MongoDB:          6.0.4

        The server generated these startup warnings when booting
        2023-11-01T22:07:13.243+05:30: Access control is not enabled for the database. Read and write access to data and configuration is unrestricted
        ------
then cls to lcean it and show dbs or show databases  to see the databases 

and note that after you run the command mongosh the directory will look like - 
test > 
    test> show dbs
    admin   40.00 KiB
    config  72.00 KiB
    local   40.00 KiB
    test>
these three are default databases . dont touch them . 

and now we need to create a new database . how will we do it  ? 
type use students , this will createa  students directory and will automatically go inside it . 

also , we can do use admin to go to the admin . 
look at this  , 


test> show databases
admin   40.00 KiB
config  72.00 KiB
local   40.00 KiB
test> use students
switched to db students
students> show dbs
admin   40.00 KiB
config  96.00 KiB
local   40.00 KiB
students> use admin
switched to db admin
admin>

ok now why if  i created a new database using use students then why its not shoing when i do show dbs ? 
its becuse databases officially do not show them untill we have at least one collection .
so note that you wont see a database listed in the output of the show dbs command untill that database contains at least one collection 
with data in it .

and to see the collections we use  show collections command .
and to add data we do someething like this  ,

        admin> use students
        switched to db students
        students> db.createCollection("data")
        { ok: 1 }
        students>
now if we do show collections 
        students> show collections
        data
        students>
and on show dbs 
        students> show dbs
        admin      40.00 KiB
        config    108.00 KiB
        local      40.00 KiB
        students    8.00 KiB
        students>
we can see the collection student ,
and now to delete it ,
        students> db.data.drop()
        true
        students>
and on show collections
        students> show collections

        students>
        students> db.dropDatabase()
        { ok: 1, dropped: 'students' }
        students> show dbs
        admin    40.00 KiB
        config  108.00 KiB
        local    40.00 KiB
        students>
